Electric Load Forecasting Project
---------------------------------

Description:
This project forecasts hourly electric load using AI/ML techniques, specifically a Random Forest Regressor model trained on historical energy consumption data.

Project Files:
1. AEP_hourly.csv                      - Dataset file containing historical hourly load values in megawatts (MW).
2. Electric_Load_Forecasting.ipynb     - Google Colab notebook containing code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.
3. actualvspredicted_load.png                    - Graph visualizing actual vs. predicted load values for a sample test period.
4. electrical_load_over_time.png
5. Electric_Load_Forecasting_Report.docx - Formal project report explaining objectives, methodology, results, and conclusion.
6. README.txt                          - This file describing the project and its contents.

How to Use:
- Open Electric_Load_Forecasting.ipynb in Google Colab.
- Upload AEP_hourly.csv when prompted.
- Run the cells sequentially to train the model and generate results.
- View files 3 and 4 for model prediction visualization.
- Refer to Electric_Load_Forecasting_Report.docx for detailed methodology and findings.

Technologies:
- Python 3.11
- Google Colab
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
